## 📋 Step-by-Step Instructions

### 🏗️ Step 1: Refactor Service Implementation with Design Patterns

### 🏗️ Step 1: Refactor Service Implementation with Design Patterns

#### 🗄️ Apply Repository Pattern to TaskService

**📂 Action**: Create/Open file `src/main/java/com/customer/taskmanager/service/impl/TaskServiceImpl.java`

**🔧 Specific Instructions**:
1. **Create service impl package**:
   - Right-click on `service` folder
   - Select "New Folder" → name it `impl`

2. **Create TaskServiceImpl.java**:
   - Right-click on `impl` folder
   - Select "New File" → name it `TaskServiceImpl.java`

3. **Add basic service structure** (if file is empty):
```java
package com.customer.taskmanager.service.impl;

import com.customer.taskmanager.service.TaskService;
import com.customer.taskmanager.model.Task;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class TaskServiceImpl implements TaskService {
    // Basic CRUD methods with placeholder implementations
}
```

4. **Select the entire class content**:
   - Click at `@Service` and drag to the final `}`
   - **Or** use `Ctrl+A` to select all

5. **Access Code Brushes**:
   - **Right-click** on selected code
   - Look for **"Copilot"** or **"Transform"** in context menu
   - **Or** press `Ctrl+I` for inline chat

6. **Copy and paste this exact transformation prompt**:

```
🏗️ REPOSITORY PATTERN REFACTOR:

Transform this service to properly implement the Repository pattern with these specific requirements:

DEPENDENCY INJECTION SETUP:
- Add private final TaskRepository taskRepository field
- Create constructor: public TaskServiceImpl(TaskRepository taskRepository)
- Add @Autowired annotation to constructor
- Add Objects.requireNonNull validation in constructor

REPOSITORY DELEGATION:
- createTask(Task task) → return taskRepository.save(task)
- getTaskById(Long id) → return taskRepository.findById(id)
- getAllTasks() → return taskRepository.findAll()
- updateTask(Task task) → return taskRepository.save(task)
- deleteTask(Long id) → taskRepository.deleteById(id)
- getTasksByAssignee(Long userId) → return taskRepository.findByAssignedUserId(userId)
- getTasksByStatus(TaskStatus status) → return taskRepository.findByStatus(status)

VALIDATION LAYER:
- Validate input parameters are not null
- Check required fields before save operations
- Validate business rules (due dates, assignments)
- Throw meaningful exceptions for invalid data

ERROR HANDLING:
- Try-catch blocks around repository operations
- Custom exceptions: TaskNotFoundException, InvalidTaskException
- Detailed error messages with context
- Proper logging with SLF4J

BUSINESS LOGIC:
- Task status transition validation
- Due date validation (not in past for new tasks)
- User assignment permission checks
- Audit trail for modifications

Generate complete, production-ready Spring Boot service implementation.
```

7. **Review and accept** the transformation
8. **Save the file** (`Ctrl+S`)
- Follow dependency injection best practices

PATTERN GOALS:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Testable service layer
- Repository abstraction for data access
- Proper exception handling chain
```
