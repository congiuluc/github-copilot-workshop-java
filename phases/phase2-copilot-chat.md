## 📋 Step-by-Step Instructions

### 🔍 Step 1: Code Review and Improvement

**🎯 Open Files**: Have your `Task.java` from Phase 1 ready

**💡 Evidence Prompt 1**: Open Copilot Chat (sidebar) and type exactly:
```
🔍 REVIEW REQUEST: Please review my Task class for a professional task management system.

Focus on:
- Field validation and data integrity
- Better encapsulation and access control
- Java best practices and conventions
- Missing functionality for enterprise use
- Security considerations

Here's my current Task class:
```

**📎 Action**: Select your entire Task class content and paste it after the prompt.

**🎯 What to Expect**: Chat will provide detailed suggestions for:
- Adding validation annotations
- Improving field types (e.g., using BigDecimal for priorities)
- Adding proper constructors
- Implementing equals/hashCode
- Suggesting additional fields

**✅ Apply Improvements**: Implement the suggestions one by one, asking follow-up questions if unclear.

### 🏗️ Step 2: Architecture Consultation

**� Specific Instructions**:
1. **Open GitHub Copilot Chat** in VS Code:
   - **Press `Ctrl+Shift+I`** (Windows/Linux) or **`Cmd+Shift+I`** (Mac)
   - **Or click** the Copilot Chat icon in the Activity Bar
   - **Or use Command Palette**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "GitHub Copilot: Open Chat"

2. **Copy and paste this exact prompt** into Copilot Chat:

```
🏛️ ARCHITECTURE CONSULTATION: I'm building a task management system in Java with these requirements:

CORE FEATURES:
- Task CRUD operations with complex filtering
- User management and authentication  
- Task assignment and workflow tracking
- Data persistence (start simple, scale later)
- Future REST API support
- Multi-tenant capability

TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS:
- Java 17+ with Maven
- Clean Architecture principles
- Testable design
- Performance considerations

Please recommend:
1. Package structure and organization
2. Key interfaces and abstractions
3. Design patterns that fit this domain
4. Data flow architecture
5. Separation of concerns strategy
```

3. **Press Enter** to send the prompt
4. **Read Copilot's response** carefully
5. **Ask follow-up questions** like:
   - "Can you show me the recommended package structure?"
   - "What interfaces should I create first?"
   - "How should I organize the service layer?"

**🎯 Expected Response**: Detailed architectural guidance including package structure, interfaces, and design patterns.

### ⚙️ Step 3: Design Service Layer Interfaces

**📂 Action**: Create new file `src/main/java/com/customer/taskmanager/service/TaskService.java`

**🔧 Specific Instructions**:
1. **Create the service package**:
   - Right-click on `src/main/java/com/customer/taskmanager`
   - Select "New Folder" 
   - Name it `service`

2. **Create TaskService.java**:
   - Right-click on `service` folder
   - Select "New File"
   - Name it `TaskService.java`

3. **Open Copilot Chat** (`Ctrl+Shift+I`)

4. **Type this exact prompt** in chat:

**💡 Evidence Prompt 3**: Request specific interface designs:
```
🔧 INTERFACE DESIGN: Based on your architectural recommendations, please generate interface definitions for:

1. TaskService - Core task operations
2. UserService - User management
3. TaskRepository - Data access abstraction

For TaskService, include methods for:
- CRUD operations (create, findById, update, delete)
- Advanced filtering (by status, priority, assignee, date range)
- Task assignment and workflow operations
- Bulk operations for efficiency

For UserService, include:
- User registration and profile management
- Authentication operations
- User search and listing

Make interfaces clean, focused, and following Java naming conventions.
```

**📂 Create Files**: Based on Chat's response, create:
- `src/main/java/com/customer/taskmanager/service/TaskService.java`
- `src/main/java/com/customer/taskmanager/service/UserService.java`
- `src/main/java/com/customer/taskmanager/repository/TaskRepository.java`
- `src/main/java/com/customer/taskmanager/repository/UserRepository.java`

### 🚨 Step 4: Exception Handling Strategy

**💡 Evidence Prompt 4**: Plan your error handling:
```
🚨 EXCEPTION STRATEGY: Design a custom exception hierarchy for my task management system.

Consider these scenarios:
- Task not found
- User not found
- Invalid task assignment (user doesn't exist)
- Business rule violations (due date in past, etc.)
- Validation failures
- Authentication/authorization failures
- Data persistence errors

Please suggest:
1. Base exception classes
2. Specific business exceptions
3. When to use checked vs unchecked exceptions
4. Error codes and message strategies
5. Integration with validation framework
```

**📂 Create Files**: Implement suggested exceptions in:
- `src/main/java/com/customer/taskmanager/exception/`

### ✅ Step 5: Validation Enhancement

**💡 Evidence Prompt 5**: Enhance your models with validation:
```
✅ VALIDATION ENHANCEMENT: Add comprehensive validation to my Task and User classes.

Requirements:
- Use Bean Validation (JSR-303) annotations
- Custom validation for business rules
- Meaningful error messages
- Group validation for different scenarios
- Cross-field validation where needed

For Task class, validate:
- Title: required, length limits
- Description: optional, max length
- Due date: must be future date
- Priority: valid enum value
- Status: valid enum value

For User class, validate:
- Username: unique, pattern requirements
- Email: valid email format
- Password: strength requirements
- Names: required, appropriate length

Show both standard and custom validation approaches.
```
