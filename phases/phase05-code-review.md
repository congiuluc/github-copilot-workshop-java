## 📋 Step-by-Step Instructions

### 🔍 Step 1: Manual Code Review in VS Code

#### 📄 Review Selected Code Sections

**📂 Action**: Open your existing Java files or create a sample class for review

**🔧 Specific Instructions**:
1. **Open or create a Java class** with potential issues:
   - Navigate to `src/main/java/com/customer/taskmanager/`
   - Open an existing service or controller file
   - Or create a new file: `CodeReviewExample.java`

2. **Add code with intentional issues** (if creating new file):
```java
package com.customer.taskmanager.example;

import java.util.*;
import java.sql.*;

public class CodeReviewExample {
    private String password = "admin123"; // Hardcoded password
    private Connection conn;
    
    public List<String> getUserData(String userId) {
        List<String> users = new ArrayList();
        String sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " + userId; // SQL injection risk
        
        try {
            Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
            ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(sql);
            while(rs.next()) {
                users.add(rs.getString("name"));
            }
        } catch(Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace(); // Poor error handling
        }
        return users;
    }
    
    public void processLargeDataset(List<Integer> numbers) {
        // Inefficient loop
        for(int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j < numbers.size(); j++) {
                if(numbers.get(i) == numbers.get(j)) {
                    System.out.println("Found duplicate: " + numbers.get(i));
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

3. **Select code for review**:
   - **Method 1**: Select specific methods or code blocks
   - **Method 2**: Select the entire class (`Ctrl+A`)
   - **Method 3**: Select problematic code sections

4. **Trigger code review**:

   - In your repository root, create `.github/` folder (if it doesn't exist)
   - Create file: `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

2. **Add comprehensive instructions**:
```markdown
## Code Review Instructions for TaskManager Project

### Security Focus
- Always check for SQL injection vulnerabilities in database queries
- Identify hardcoded credentials or API keys
- Verify proper input validation and sanitization
- Check for authentication and authorization issues

### Code Quality Standards
- Ensure proper exception handling with meaningful error messages
- Verify null safety and defensive programming practices
- Check for performance issues in loops and data processing
- Validate proper logging practices (no sensitive data in logs)

### Java-Specific Guidelines
- Follow Java naming conventions (camelCase, PascalCase)
- Ensure proper use of Optional for nullable returns
- Check for proper resource management (try-with-resources)
- Validate Stream API usage for collection operations

### Architecture Patterns
- Verify separation of concerns between layers
- Check for proper dependency injection usage
- Ensure controllers only handle HTTP concerns
- Validate service layer contains business logic only

### Testing Considerations
- Identify code that lacks test coverage
- Suggest improvements for testability
- Check for proper mocking and isolation in tests
```

3. **Create path-specific instructions** (optional):
   - Create `.github/instructions/` folder
   - Add `security.instructions.md` for security-focused reviews:
```markdown
Focus on security vulnerabilities including:
- SQL injection in database queries
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) potential
- Authentication bypass possibilities
- Data exposure through logging
- Insecure cryptographic practices
```

#### 🎯 Test Custom Instructions

**🔧 Validation Steps**:
1. **Make code changes** that should trigger your custom instructions
2. **Request a new review** using any of the methods above
3. **Verify** that Copilot's feedback aligns with your custom instructions
4. **Refine instructions** based on the quality of feedback received

### 🚀 Step 5: Advanced Review Scenarios

#### 🧪 Performance Analysis

**🎯 Create performance-critical code** for review:
```java
public class PerformanceExample {
    // Intentionally inefficient code for review
    public List<String> findDuplicates(List<String> items) {
        List<String> duplicates = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < items.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < items.size(); j++) {
                if (items.get(i).equals(items.get(j))) {
                    duplicates.add(items.get(i));
                }
            }
        }
        return duplicates;
    }
    
    public void processData(List<Data> dataList) {
        // Multiple database calls in loop
        for (Data data : dataList) {
            database.save(data); // N+1 problem
            auditLog.log(data.getId()); // Another call per iteration
        }
    }
}
```

**💡 Review Focus**: Ask Copilot to specifically analyze:
- Time complexity issues
- Memory usage patterns
- Database interaction efficiency
- Caching opportunities

#### 🔧 Maintainability Review

**🎯 Create complex code** that needs refactoring:
```java
public class MaintenabilityExample {
    public String processUserRequest(String type, String data, boolean isAdmin, 
                                   int priority, String userId, Date timestamp) {
        if(type.equals("CREATE")) {
            if(isAdmin || priority > 5) {
                if(data != null && data.length() > 0) {
                    // Complex nested logic
                    return "Created: " + data + " by " + userId;
                } else {
                    return "Invalid data";
                }
            } else {
                return "Insufficient permissions";
            }
        } else if(type.equals("UPDATE")) {
            // Similar complex structure...
        }
        return "Unknown operation";
    }
}
```

**💡 Review Focus**: Request analysis for:
- Method complexity reduction
- Parameter object extraction
- Strategy pattern opportunities
- Single responsibility violations
