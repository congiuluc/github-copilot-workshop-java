## 📋 Step-by-Step Instructions

### ✅ Step 1: Enhance Task Model with Validation

**📂 Action**: Open existing file `src/main/java/com/customer/taskmanager/model/Task.java`

**🔧 Specific Instructions**:
1. **Open Task.java** from Phase 1 in VS Code
2. **Select entire Task class** content:
   - Click at the start of `public class Task {`
   - Drag to select everything until the closing `}`
   - **Or use** `Ctrl+A` to select all content
3. **Press `Ctrl+I`** (Windows/Linux) or **`Cmd+I`** (Mac) to activate Inline Chat
4. **Copy and paste this exact prompt**:

```
Add comprehensive Bean Validation to this Task class:

VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Title: @NotBlank, @Size(max=100), trim whitespace
- Description: @Size(max=500), allow null
- Priority: @NotNull with meaningful error message
- Status: @NotNull, default to TODO if not set
- Due date: @Future if provided, allow null
- Created date: @NotNull, auto-set to now() in constructor
- Assigned user ID: @Positive if provided

ADDITIONAL FEATURES:
- Add @Valid annotations where needed
- Include custom error messages
- Add a validation method isValidForAssignment()
- Generate proper toString() with all fields
```

5. **Press Enter** to submit the prompt
6. **Review the preview** that Inline Chat shows
7. **Click "Accept"** to apply the changes
8. **Save the file** (`Ctrl+S`) and verify compilation

**🎯 What to Expect**: Inline Chat will show a preview of your class with:
- Import statements for validation annotations
- Fields annotated with appropriate constraints
- Enhanced constructors
- Validation helper methods

**✅ Action**: Review and accept the changes, then test compilation.

### 🏗️ Step 2: Add Builder Pattern

**📍 Position**: Place cursor at the end of the Task class, just before the closing `}`

**💡 Evidence Prompt 2**: Press `Ctrl+I` and type:
```
Add a Builder pattern for Task creation:

BUILDER REQUIREMENTS:
- Static inner Builder class
- Fluent API with method chaining
- Validation in build() method
- Set default values (status=TODO, createdDate=now)
- Include a static builder() method to start
- Example: Task.builder().title("My Task").priority(HIGH).build()
```

### 🧠 Step 3: Add Business Logic Methods

**📍 Position**: After the builder code, still in Task class

**💡 Evidence Prompt 3**: Press `Ctrl+I` and type:
```
Add business logic methods to Task:

METHODS NEEDED:
- isOverdue(): boolean - check if task is past due date
- isAssigned(): boolean - check if task has assigned user
- getDaysUntilDue(): long - calculate days until due (negative if overdue)
- markAsCompleted(): void - set status to DONE, set completion date
- assignTo(Long userId): void - assign task with validation
- canBeDeleted(): boolean - business rules for deletion
- getPriorityWeight(): int - numerical weight for sorting
```

### 👤 Step 4: Enhance User Model

**📂 Open File**: `User.java`

**🎯 Selection**: Select the entire User class

**💡 Evidence Prompt 4**: Press `Ctrl+I` and type:
```
Enhance this User class with:

VALIDATION:
- Username: @NotBlank, @Size(min=3, max=20), @Pattern for alphanumeric
- Email: @NotBlank, @Email, @Size(max=100)
- Password: @NotBlank, @Size(min=8), custom pattern validation
- First/Last Name: @NotBlank, @Size(max=50), trim whitespace
- Created date: @NotNull, auto-set

BUSINESS METHODS:
- getFullName(): String - concatenate first + last
- isActive(): boolean - check account status
- updatePassword(String newPassword): void - with validation
- getDisplayName(): String - username or full name
- hasValidProfile(): boolean - check all required fields
```

### 🔧 Step 5: Add Utility and Helper Methods

**📍 Position**: Choose any model class and place cursor after existing methods

**💡 Evidence Prompt 5**: Press `Ctrl+I` and type:
```
Add utility methods for data handling:

FOR TASK CLASS:
- toSummaryString(): String - brief one-line description
- fromMap(Map<String, Object> data): Task - static factory method
- toMap(): Map<String, Object> - for serialization
- copy(): Task - deep copy method

FOR USER CLASS:
- toPublicView(): UserDTO - safe representation without password
- validatePasswordStrength(String password): boolean
- generateUsername(String email): String - extract from email
```

## 🎯 Advanced Inline Chat Techniques

### 🔄 Iterative Improvement Pattern
**💡 Try This Sequence**:
```
1st Request: "Add basic validation to this method"
2nd Request: "Make the validation more comprehensive"  
3rd Request: "Add custom error messages"
4th Request: "Add unit test for this validation"
```

### 🎨 Code Style Improvements
**📍 Select any method and try**:
```
"Improve this method's readability and add JavaDoc comments"
"Refactor this method to be more functional programming style"
"Add error handling and logging to this method"
```

### 🔍 Debugging and Fixes
**📍 Select problematic code**:
```
"Fix any potential null pointer exceptions in this code"
"Add defensive programming checks"
"Optimize this code for better performance"
```

1. Select the method
2. `Ctrl+I`: "Break this method into smaller, focused methods"
3. Review and accept changes
4. `Ctrl+I`: "Add JavaDoc to each new method"

### 🎯 Exercise 2: Error Handling Enhancement
**📍 Target**: Your User class constructor
**💡 Steps**:
1. Select constructor code

## 💡 Inline Chat Best Practices

### ✅ Do's - Maximize Effectiveness:

| 🎯 Practice | 💡 Example | 🏆 Result |
|-------------|------------|-----------|
| **🎯 Be Specific** | "Add null checks to constructor parameters" vs "improve this" | Precise changes |
| **📍 Use Selection** | Select exact code to modify | Targeted improvements |
| **🔄 Iterate** | Make small changes, then build on them | Better control |
| **💬 Use Context** | "Based on this validation pattern, add similar to other fields" | Consistent code |
| **🧪 Test After** | Always compile and test after accepting changes | Quality assurance |

### ❌ Don'ts - Avoid These Mistakes:

| ⚠️ Pitfall | 💡 Better Approach | 🎯 Why |
|-------------|-------------------|--------|
| **"Rewrite everything"** | **"Add validation to the title field"** | Manageable changes |
| **No code selection** | **Select specific method/field** | Precise modifications |
| **Accept blindly** | **Review each change carefully** | Code quality |
| **Vague requests** | **Specify exact requirements** | Better results |
